  <h2>The Bees Knees</h2>
  <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
    from San Francisco, California. The band
    consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
    vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
    keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved
    its first commercial success as an unsigned act,
    drawing attention from their future manager.
    Having extensive experience working with
    both new and seasoned acts, the manager was
    confident the band could succeed even further
    with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to
    sign with a well known record label.
    </p>
    <p>From there, the band has soared, gaining
    international recognition and ranking in the top
    10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately
    fell in love with the band’s original and organic
    attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
    hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this
    century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves
    as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid
    and authentic performances on stage. The
    Bees Knees are currently recording their
    second studio album, looking to be released in
    early 2024.
